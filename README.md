## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express

## Optimizations

No huge refactoring/optimization yet. The goal is to add this to MongoDB and update quarterly with new dividend yielding stocks

## Takeways/New Lessons

The biggest takeaway from this experience was definitely deploying to Heroku. By working with a combination of the remote repository on GitHub and the deployment of the application on Heroku, I got a lot of experience making commits/pushes and experimenting with various middlewares. Can't lie, it was a long lesson to learn.

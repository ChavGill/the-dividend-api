# the-dividend-api

Love Parks and Rec and need information about your favorite characters for your frontend, backend, or fullstack web apps? Look no further! I have created Ron's worst nightmare, a Parks and Rec API with information about many recurring characters in the series from all 7 seasons.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express

## Optimizations

No huge refactoring/optimization yet. The goal is to add this to MongoDB and update quarterly with new dividend yielding stocks

## Takeways/New Lessons

The biggest takeaway from this experience was definitely deploying to Heroku. By working with a combination of the remote repository on GitHub and the deployment of the application on Heroku, I got a lot of experience making commits/pushes and experimenting with various middlewares. Can't lie, it was a long lesson to learn.
